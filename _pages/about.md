# Your Name

Dr. Emma Lehmberg (she/her)
IISD Experimental Lakes Area 
Department of Biology, Lakehead University

## About Me
I am a postdoctoral researcher broadly interested in aquatic evolution, with a particular interest sexual selection, macroevolution, and adaptation in the Anthropocene. 
Currently, I am a Mitacs Fellow working at IISD Experimental Lakes Area and Lakehead University 
on a project that looks to characterize Lake Trout mating system and compare estimates of effective population size (Ne) with 
mark-recapture population estimates. Previously, I worked with Nicholas Mandrak and Nathan Lovejoy at University of Toronto Scarborough to characterize the diets
of Lake Trout using next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. I received my PhD at Texas A&M University, working with Gil Rosenthal and Heath Blackmon on the macroevolutionary
signatures of hybridization and sexual conflict in the livebearing Poeciliidae.
